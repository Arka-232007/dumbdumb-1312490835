        <p>
            You‚Äôre more than just a friend to me‚Äî, my partner in crime, and the sister I never had.
             Life feels brighter and so much more fun with you in it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for being by my side through thick and thin. 
            I‚Äôm so lucky to have someone as special as you in my life. ‚ù§Ô∏è
         
        </p>
  
        <p>
         
            In your smile, the sun takes flight,<br>
            A spark of joy, so pure, so bright.<br>
            Your laughter's music, a sweet serenade,<br>
            A melody in which my heart‚Äôs swayed.<br>
        </p>

        <p>

            They call us just friends, but truth be told,<br>
            You‚Äôre a treasure, more precious than gold.<br>
            If wanting to be with you is a sin, I'll gladly confess<br>
            Without you around, I may just be a mess in a bin<br>
